# Space Habitat Designer 🚀

**Space Habitat Designer** is an interactive web-based simulator for designing residential and working space modules in outer space.  
The project helps visualize and optimize the design of habitable space modules adapted to different environments such as Mars, the Moon, the ISS, or long-duration interplanetary missions.

## 🧠 Project Overview
This tool is designed for engineers, architects, students, and space technology enthusiasts who want to:
- select a target environment (Mars, Moon, ISS, or Transit Module),
- define module parameters (length, width, height, crew size),
- design functional zones (sleeping areas, laboratories, kitchen, etc.),
- receive basic analytics on habitability and space usage,
- export project results as **JSON** data or **PNG** images.

## ✨ Key Features
- 💫 **Environment selection**: adapts design constraints to different gravity and space conditions.  
- 🧱 **Modular editor**: intuitive placement of functional zones and elements.  
- 📊 **Analytics**: basic calculations of living space per crew member and validation of essential zones.  
- 📤 **Export options**: save designs as structured data (JSON) or images (PNG).

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  

## 🧪 Methodology & Inspiration
The design logic and validation rules are inspired by publicly available NASA guidelines and research related to space habitat and life-support system design.

## 📁 Use Cases
- prototyping layouts for a lunar base  
- designing a residential module for a Mars mission  
- educational tool for learning space architecture and habitat planning
